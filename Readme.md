# Data Compression using Huffman Coding
### Compresses the string of any type into a binary string using Huffman Coding.
### It Decodes the encoded binary string into actual string, Encodes the string into its binary form
### In Enhanced Encoding the input of the string should be provided in he form of map of increased frequencies.
### The difference between Enhanced encoding and the regular one is Enhanced encoding is done with Time Complexity O(C) and the regular one is done in O(ClogC), where C is the no. of characters in the string. 



## Example:
### string : "tattarrattat"
### Encoded String : "011001110101100110"
### huffman_tree: (t,(r,a))

### Encoded String : "011001110101100110"
### Map: {'t' : 0, 'a' : 11, 'r' : 10}
### Decoded String : "tattarrattat"
